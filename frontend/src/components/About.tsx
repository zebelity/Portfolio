I'm a software engineer based in Sydney with a background in physiotherapy. I have a passion for applying my skills, care and attention to detail to help people achieve their goals without pain and frustration.

I always want to learn and grow. Software engineering allows me to create excellent user experiences, making a real and meaningful impact on people's lives by solving their pain points.

I have recently completed General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive, a 400+ hour bootcamp where I have built experience with both frontend and backend technologies.

People would describe me as fun, caring, analytical, organized, and dependable.
